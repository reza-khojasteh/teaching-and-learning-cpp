# C++ Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects created for learning purposes. Each project is designed to demonstrate a specific C++ concept.

## Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory. The directory name indicates the topic covered by the project. For example, the `1-intro-to-modules` directory contains a project that demonstrates the use of modules in C++.

## How to Build and Run the Projects

Each project is a Visual Studio solution. To build and run a project, open the `.sln` file in the project's directory with Visual Studio and then build and run it from there.
